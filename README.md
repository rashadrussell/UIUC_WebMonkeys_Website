=======================

This is the repository for the Web Monkeys Website at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Our website is located at www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys.

Also, the Web Monkeys Website is a Wordpress site, so some PHP functions are Wordpress specific functions. 

It is recommended that you visit this page: http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page if you don't know how to develop for Wordpress. This is the Wordpress documentation
where it teaches you where to get started.
